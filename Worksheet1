 Q1 What is the size of float and double in java?
  Ans)Float is of size 32 bits while double is of size 64 bits.
  
  
 Q2 Automatic type conversion is possible in which of the possible cases?
Ans) This happens when: The two data types are compatible. When we assign a value of a smaller data type to a bigger data type
 Automatic type conversion is possible in Int to Long.
 
 
Q3 Find the output of the following code.
int Integer = 24;
char String = ‘I’;
System.out.print(Integer);
System.out.print(String);
Ans)As the given statements are valid,output is 24I


Q4. Find the output of the following program.
public class Solution{
public static void main(String[] args){
short x = 10;
x = x * 5;
System.out.print(x);
}
}
Ans)x=x*5
x=50
but in the program x is short data type and 5 is int datatype
it is not possible to store int value in short so
ans) Compile time error


Q5.Find the output of the following program.
public class Solution{
public static void main(String[] args){
byte x = 127;
x++;
x++;
System.out.print(x);
}
}
Ans)As the byte data type in Java is cyclic in nature, an increment to 127 is -128,and another increment to -128 is -127(-128+1),Answer is -127.


Q6. Select the valid statement.
A. char[] ch = new char(5)
B. char[] ch = new char[5]
C. char[] ch = new char()
D. char[] ch = new char[]
Ans)The syntax for declaring and creating an array variable in java is:
dataType[] arrayRefVar = new dataType[arraySize];

Thus, option (A) and option (c) is syntactically wrong as parentheses( ( ) ) is used instead of square brackets( [ ] ).
Option (D) is incorrect as the size of the array is missing.
char[] ch = new char[5] is the correct syntax for declaring a character array.


Q7. Find the output of the following program.
public class Solution{
public static void main(String[] args){
int[] x = {120, 200, 016};
for(int i = 0; i < x.length; i++){
System.out.print(x[i] + “ “);
}
}
}
Ans)016 is an octal number. The prefix 0 indicates that a number is in octal.so answer is 120 200 14.


Q8.When an array is passed to a method, what does the method receive?
A. The reference of the array
B. A copy of the array
C. Length of the array
D. Copy of first element
Ans)You can pass arrays to a method just like normal variables. When we pass an array to a method as an argument, actually the address of the array in the memory is passed (reference). 
Therefore, any changes to this array in the method will affect the array.


Q9.Find the value of A[1] after execution of the following program.
int[] A = {0,2,4,1,3};
for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
a[i] = a[(a[i] + 3) % a.length];
}
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
Ans)when i = 0;
a[i] = a[(a[i]+3)%a.length] //a.length =5;
a[0] = a[(a[0]+3)%5];
a[0] = a[(0+3)%5] ; // 3
a[0] = a[3] = 1
when i = 1;
a[1]=a[(a[1]+3)%5];
a[1]=a[(2+3)%5];
a[1]=a[0];
a[1]=1;
Therefore a[1] is equal to 1



Q10. When is the object created with a new keyword?
A. At run time
B. At compile time
C. Depends on the code
D. None
Ans)The object created with a new keyword during run-time.

11. Identify the corrected definition of a package.
A. A package is a collection of editing tools
B. A package is a collection of classes
C. A package is a collection of classes and interfaces
D. A package is a collection of interfaces
Ans)A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations ) providing access protection and namespace management.



Q12.Identify the keyword among the following that makes a variable belong to a
class,rather than being defined for each instance of the class.
A. final
B. static
C. volatile
D. abstract
Ans)2. (B) Static keyword makes a variable belong to a class,rather than being defined for
each instance of the class.


Q13.Identify what can directly access and change the value of the variable res.
Package com.mypackage;
Public class Solution{
Private int res = 100;
}
A. Any class
B. Only Solution class
C. Any class that extends Solution
D. None
Ans)(B) Only solution class can directly access and change the value of the variable res.




Q14.In which of the following is the toString() method defined?
A. java.lang.Object
B. java.lang.String
C. java.lang.util
D. None
Ans)The toString method is in the Object class, the parent class in java, so it's available in every class in java by default. 
The method can be used on any object required to be represented in a String format.
option A


Q15.Identify the output of the following program.
String str = “abcde”;
System.out.println(str.substring(1, 3));
A. abc
B. bc
C. bcd
D. cd
Ans)substring() method has two variants and returns a new string that is a substring of this string. The substring begins with the character at the specified index and extends to the end of this string or upto endIndex - 1 if second argument is given.
Syntax: Here is the syntax of this method:
public String substring(int beginIndex)
or
public String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)
Parameters: Here is the detail of parameters:
beginIndex -- the begin index, inclusive.
endIndex -- the end index, exclus 
bc is the option
